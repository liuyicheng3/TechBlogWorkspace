-keepclassmembers class ** {
    public void onEvent*(**);
}

只保护 public void onEvent*(**)的方法不被重命名

-keepattributes Signature


-keep class okio.** {*;}


-keep class android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat**{
    public *;
}


-keep class com.veda.lyc.Utils{ static *;}  
保持里面的静态方法不被混淆

keep的几个选项


| Keep        | From being removed or renamed   |  From being renamed  |
| --------   | -----:  | :----:  |
| Classes and class members     | -keep |   -keepnames     |
| Class members only        |   -keepclassmembers   |   -keepclassmembernames   |
| 	-keepclassmembers	-keepclassmembernames
Classes and class members, if class members present       |    -keepclasseswithmembers    |  -keepclasseswithmembernames  |
